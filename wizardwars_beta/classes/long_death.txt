Necromancer - Lord over all that is Death, the Necromancer brings the souls of the dead back, to undeath, for a corpse has no fear or sense of pain, and thus makes the perfect soldier. Outcasted from villages and empires for the often dark practices that are involved with Necromancy, such as grave robbing and sacrifices, the Black Magi tend to find new means to sustain themselves, such as siphoning the life of wayward travelers.
