2 Fortresses - For Wizard Wars
    - Capture The Grail -
================================
by Rikers

In the land of Arathas, there were two fortresses.
They were built too close together, and there is war.

Objective: Enter the enemy Base and make
your way to where their Grail resides in the
Basement. Grab it and bring it back to your
Battlements. Bring it to the center to
Capture it. 

Scoring: 10 Points to Capturing Person.
         10 Points to Capturing Team.

Other Notes: Grail carriers drop the Grail when
they die. Dropped Grails return to their Base
after 60 seconds.
