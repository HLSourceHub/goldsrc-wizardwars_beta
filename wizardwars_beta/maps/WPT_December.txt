DeGlove's WW_December waypoints for Codiac's HPB Port

v 1.0 Tested and working. Bots will cap and navigate.
If you find any problems let me know on the forums.

Done: 
-Team only waypointing in spawn
-Partial one way system around bases (bots are forced to grab the grail if it is there instead of running out the bottom and leaving it)
-Team only access to sniper nests
-Spellbooks waypointed
-Area on top of the main door waypointed
-All outside areas waypointed

Might need improvement
-Haven;t yet seen a bot climb the rope up to the top (need to move jump waypoint at base of ladder, or create jump and crouch)- would fall off the top and die anyway.
-Possibly re-do autowaypointed sections to speed bot movement
-Breakable detection, depending on how Codiac implements it
-Might re-do spawn rooms so the shelf is waypointed

Bugs solved:
-Bots getting stuck at the top of the stairs in another team's spawn
-Red team not being connected
-Red team not having one-way system
-Door not waypointed properly
