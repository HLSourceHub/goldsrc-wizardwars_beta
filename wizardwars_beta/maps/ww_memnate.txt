Blue and Red Objectives:  
- Take control of the Ring
- Jump through the Ring to gain control
- The Ring can only be controlled for 30 seconds
- After the 30 seconds, Yellow regains control

Yellow Objective: 
- Defend the Ring
- Stop Blue and Red from controlling the Ring
- The Ring returns to Yellow control after 30 seconds

Scoring:
- 1 point for taking control of the Ring
- 1 point per 6 seconds of controlling the Ring
- 1 bonus point to Blue and Red for holding
     the Ring the entire 30 seconds

Notes:
- There is "safe" time after taking control of the Ring.
- This means if two players are going for the Ring at
     the same time, the first player through the Ring
     will ensure control of the Ring for their team
     for the next few seconds.
- This basically makes it a race for the ring.
