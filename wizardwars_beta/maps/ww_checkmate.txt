are at war. The Wizards of Arathas have been 
called in from a nearby dimension to help 
bring order out of chaos.
 
Main objective:  Offense - Go to the enemy 
dungeon and break your king out of the dungeon, 
then bring him back to your castle and back 
to his rightful place on his throne.

rescuing their king!

The blue team is allied with the white castle.

         10 Points to rescuing Team.

2nd objective:  Your dragon has been kidnapped
by the enemy team.  You must free your dragon!
Simply destroy the metal cage that surrounds
him. Once you do, he will be yours to ride! If
Dragon dies, he will respawn again shortly.

Other Notes: Players can touch their team's 
queen to restock mana, health, and satchels!
The Queen only restocks every 5 seconds or so.

King carriers will drop him in place if they 
die. Dropped kings will return to the enemy 
prison after 30 seconds.
