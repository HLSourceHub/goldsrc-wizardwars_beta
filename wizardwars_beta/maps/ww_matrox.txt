your way to where their Grail resides in the
courtyards. Grab it and bring it back to your
Battlements and capture it by touching the 
rune on the ground.

         10 Points to Capturing Team.

Other Notes: Grail carriers drop the grail 
when they die. Dropped Grails return to

bridge.  It will attack any enemy players that
try to cross it,  If a dragon is killed, it will
respawn again shortly.
