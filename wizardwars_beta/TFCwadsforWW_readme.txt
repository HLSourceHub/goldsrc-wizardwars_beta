	Now we distribut this with Wizard Wars.

10/22/01

This is the replacement TFC.wad and TFC2.wad for Wizard wars.
It now supports the new Valve TFC maps (Avanti, Casbah, and Flagrun) in the Half-Life 1.1.0.4 patch.

Installation:

Unzip the the tfc.wad and tfc2.wad into your "Half-Life/wizwars" directory. 

After successful installation of these TFC wad files, any TFC team logo in a map should be replaced by the Wizard Wars symbol of the correct color.  It should work on every TFC map unless the map author used a different wad file when he made his map.  Or, unless he compiled all his textures into the map, then you will still see the normal TFC logos. :(

Remember, you must have any TFC map that you want to play in WW installed in your /wizwars/ directory.  You cannot just leave it installed in TFC in order for it to work.
